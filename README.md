### What's this about?

This is a simple little project for React 16.8.3,
with the new React hooks API's.
You can see it running here: [https://bazzer588.github.io/hooky/](https://bazzer588.github.io/hooky/)

Hooks allow functional components to have state - this is very different to
the old class based model

There are no classes in this project!
All the code is in functional components.

An issue was raised concerning callback handling using the hooks API

See the discussion here:
https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/14099

And the documentation here:
https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-faq.html#how-to-read-an-often-changing-value-from-usecallback


### How do I run it myself?

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
